Introduction
============

This file contains an incomplete list of people who have contributed to
``pycelle``. It is an *inclusive* list, and anyone who has contributed who
wishes to make that contribution known is welcome to add an entry into this
file. As a rule, no name should be added to this list without the approval of
the person associated with that name.

In general, creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult, and
the list within this file is almost certainly incomplete.  In general,
contributors include end users, testers, bug reporters, build/integration
systems such as
`TravisCI <https://travis-ci.org>`_,
`coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`_, and
`readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_,
contributors who wish to remain anonymous, funding sources, advisors, etc.
Simply stated: ``pycelle`` is a collaborative project.

Do you want to make your contribution known? If you have commit access, edit
this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to open
a `ticket <https://github.com/ComSciCtr/pycelle/issues/new>`_ or get in contact
with one of the official team
`members <https://github.com/ComSciCtr?tab=members>`_.

A supplementary (but still incomplete) list of contributors is given by the
list of names that have commits in ``pycelle``'s `git <http://git-scm.com>`_
repository. This can be obtained via::

    git log --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq

Additional contributors (e.g. organizations) are listed in `HISTORY.rst`.
